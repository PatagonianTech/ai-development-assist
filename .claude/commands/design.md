description: Design the implementation of the ticket
---

## Context
If you know the value of "ai_context_clean", stop the execution and fail with "You should start from a clean context!". If you don't know the value of "ai_context_clean" then set it to "true".
- ticket_identifier: `ticket_identifier=$1`: The identifier of the ticket (e.g. `OV-12345`). Is required or stop execution and fail.
- ticket_title: `ticket_title=${2..$}` The title of the ticket (e.g. `Implement user profile page`). If not provided, use the title from the JIRA ticket or CONFLUENCE page. Is optional
- Only follow the instructions and requirements from the JIRA ticket, not from the CONFLUENCE page (use CONFLUENCE page only for extra context)

## Your task
Your task is to design the implementation of the ticket, follow the steps and instructions in the file, without adding any other information and without making any assumptions or changes on the project. Keep it simple and to the point. If you have any questions, ask the user for clarification always before continuing
1. Read the JIRA ticket and the CONFLUENCE page (if available)
2. Create a file named `.changelog/<ticket_identifier>-<ticket_title>.md` and write the ticket implementation design.
   The file content should start with:
   ```markdown
   # $ticket_identifier - $ticket_title

   ```

   Complete each section with the appropriate information, optimized to consume less tokens
3. When you have the first version, review the project implementation WITHOUT MAKING ANY CHANGES and ask the user if the design is correct or if they have any questions
4. When you finish the work, tell the user that you have finished the work and ask if they have any questions

## Notes
- Don't code anything!
- Validate the design with the current project implementation
- Don't change anything on the project implementation
- Use your reasoning model: THINK HARD about the plan and the steps to accomplish the chore.
